### Printing help:
I suggest you print in PETG or ABS. Avoid PLA because it's not a suitable filament for end use prints.

Generally, my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. Reference the supplied printOrientation .3mf file found in the STL folder for each mount.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping. M3 holes should be drilled out to M2.5 then tapped with the M3 tap. These are the four holes surrounding to top plate. The M1.6 holes should be drilled out to M1.4 then tapped with the m1.6 tap.

When assembling the rotating and shift assemblies use some synthetic grease similar to Super Lube PTFE or keycap lube to make the shift and rotate function smoother.

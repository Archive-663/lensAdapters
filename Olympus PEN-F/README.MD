### Story Time:
I picked up an Olympus PEN-F a while ago to see if there was any chance I could adapt some modern APS-C mirrorless or DLSR lenses to better it's lens selection. The unfortunate answer is that it's mostly "no." While the flange focal distance is pretty short, the mirror actually protrudes too much into the actual lens mount so more often than not the mirror would slap the rear lens element of most adapted mirrorless and even Leica M mount lenses. There is hope for APS-C DSLR lenses. I'm working on adapting a zoom lens and trying to figure out how to make a much more compact circular fish eye lense out of a few Meike lenses.

So while mirrorless lenses were out of the question, there was still a significant gap between me using DSLR lenses on my PEN-F. I could only find a third-party EF to PEN-F adapter and the official PEN-F adapters were few and far between online. So, I figured let's fix that issue while having some fun. I started with the M42 mount because the mount is pretty easy to build on since there are no moving parts that engage from the camera mount to the lens flange. But really, the only way to open up more lenses was to develop an easy to print and assemble Nikon F and Canon EF adapter.

Since, both, Canon and Nikon have a pin lock system, I needed to design a reliable pin locking system that was easy to print with few bought parts. I came up with a simple wedge lever locking system to positively engage the locking pins into the cavity on the lens flanges. It works reliably, prints well, and doesn't require any premade springs or parts. I wanted to do it this way to increase the accessiblilty of the adapters. With fewer parts that need to be bought it's easier for anyone in the world to print, assemble, and use; only having to purchase standardized M1.6 x 6mm machine screws.

Funnily enough, the designing of the shift lenses required me to design an L-Bracket system for the Pen-F cameras. Which can be found here: [Lot no. 007 | Olympus Pen-F accessories](https://github.com/Archive-663/olympusPENF)

### Features:
- 0.71x focal reduction

### What you'll need:
- Viltrox or similar speedbooster/focal reducer element
- 9x M1.6 x 5mm pan head screws
- 1x M1.6 tap

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit
- M1.8/M2 drill bit

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M1.6 requires M1.4 bore followed by an M1.6 tap.
- M1.8 or M2 bore on Mount Rings part.

When assembling the rotating, and shift assemblies use synthetic grease similar to Super Lube PTFE or keycap lube to make the shift and rotate function smoother. It will help with parts longevity as well. Additionally, grease the threads on the machine screw to allow for smoother engagement.

### Help support Archive 663 with a dontation or monthly sub

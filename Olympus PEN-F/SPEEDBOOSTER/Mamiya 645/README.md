### Features:
- 0.71x focal reduction

### What you'll need:
- Viltrox or similar speedbooster/focal reducer element
- 9x M1.6 x 5mm pan head screws
- 1x M1.6 tap

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit
- M1.8/M2 drill bit

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
The speedbooster element needs to be press fit into the housing. You may need to wrap a bit of gaffer's tape around the threads of the element to have it press fit snuggly. 

Install the speedbooster element flipped from it's standard orientation in the original speedbooster. 

Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M1.6 requires M1.4 bore followed by an M1.6 tap.
- M1.8 or M2 bore on Mount Rings part.

When assembling the rotating, and shift assemblies use synthetic grease similar to Super Lube PTFE or keycap lube to make the shift and rotate function smoother. It will help with parts longevity as well. Additionally, grease the threads on the machine screw to allow for smoother engagement.

Please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, <a href="https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">download FreeCAD</a> to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble. If using FreeCAD, the naming conventions should carry over and you will be able to see which lens element you need from the various smartphone lenses. (Verified in FreeCAD 0.18) If using something like Solid Edge open the file as an assembly to retain the names of the parts.

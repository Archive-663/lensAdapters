This is a basic shift adapter for using M42 lenses on Olympus Pen-F cameras.

### Features:
- +/- 7mm of shift
- 90 degree rotation for both portrait and vertical shift

### What you'll need:
- Either
  - 1x m5 x 50mm hex head machine screw
  - 1x 10-24 x 2" hex head machine screw
  - or 1x 10-32 x 2" hex head machine screw
- 4x m3 x 3mm set screws (or grub screws)
- 4x m1.6 x5mm pan head screws
- 1x m3 tap
- 1x m1.6 tap
- 1x m5/10-24/10-32 tap

### What would be helpful:
- m1.4 drill bit
- m2.5 drill bit
- m4.5/No. 25 drill bit
- m5/3/16 drill bit

### Printing help:
I print with PETG because it's pretty easy to set up with and dial in. If you want to use something else, go for it. I'd stay away from PLA because it's not the best in heat and against solvents. 

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied [print orientation gcode (do not use this to print)](https://github.com/Archive-663/lensAdapters/blob/main/Olympus%20PEN-F/SHIFT/M42-PENF/ASSETS/printOrientationExample.gcode). Below you'll find screenshots of the orientation.

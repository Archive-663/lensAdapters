## M42 to PEN-F Dumb Adapter

This is a basic adapter for using M42 lenses on Olympus Pen-F cameras.

### What you'll need:
- 4x m3 x 3mm set screws (or grub screws)
- 4x m1.6 x 5mm pan head screws
- 1x m3 tap
- 1x m1.6 tap++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

### What would be helpful:
- m1.4 drill bit
- m1.8/m2 drill bit
- m2.5 drill bit

### Printing help:
I print with PETG because it's pretty easy to set up with and dial in. If you want to use something else, go for it. I'd stay away from PLA because it's not the best in heat and against solvents. 

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied [print orientation gcode (do not use this to print)](https://github.com/Archive-663/lensAdapters/blob/main/Olympus%20PEN-F/SHIFT/M42-PENF/ASSETS/printOrientationExample.gcode). Below you'll find screenshots of the orientation.

### Assembly help:
I suggest drilling holds to their correct tap size before tapping. M3 holes should be drilled out to m2.5 then tapped with the m3 tap. These are the four holes surrounding to top plate. The m1.6 holes should be drilled out to 1.4 then tapped with the m1.6 tap. The Rotator holes should be drilled out with an m2 or m1.8 drill bit.

When assembling the rotating and shift assemblies use some synthetic grease similar to Super Lube PTFE or keycap lube to make the shift and rotate function smoother.

## Nikon F to PEN-F Dumb Adapter

### Features:
- Simple Lever Lens Pin Lock System.
- Not G lens compatible

### What you'll need:
- 8x M1.6 x 5mm pan head screws
- 1x M1.6 tap

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M1.6 requires M1.4 bore followed by an M1.6 tap.

To assemble correctly, use indexing dots to orient the parts.

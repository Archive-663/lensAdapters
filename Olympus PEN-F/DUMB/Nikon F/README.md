## Nikon F to PEN-F Dumb Adapter

### Features:
- Simple Lever Lens Pin Lock System.
- Not G lens compatible

### What you'll need:
- 8x M1.6 x 5mm pan head screws
- 1x M1.6 tap

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit
- M1.8/M2 drill bit

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M1.6 requires M1.4 bore followed by an M1.6 tap.
- M1.8 or M2 bore on Rotator part.

To assemble correctly, use indexing dots to orient the parts.

Please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, <a href="https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">download FreeCAD</a> to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble. If using FreeCAD, the naming conventions should carry over and you will be able to see which lens element you need from the various smartphone lenses. (Verified in FreeCAD 0.18) If using something like Solid Edge open the file as an assembly to retain the names of the parts.

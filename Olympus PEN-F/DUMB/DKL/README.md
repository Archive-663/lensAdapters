## Deckel DKL to PEN-F Dumb Adapter

### Features:
- Simple Push/Pull Lens Lock System.
- Basic F-stop printable label from F/2 to F/22

### What you'll need:
- 9x M1.6 x 5mm pan head screws (if using PETG
  OR
- 9x M1.6/1.7 x 5mm self tapping screws (if using ABS or PETG)
- 1x M1.6 tap
- 1x M2 x 7mm set screw or pan head screw

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit
- M1.8/M2 drill bit

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M1.6 requires M1.4 bore followed by an M1.6 tap.
- M1.8 or M2 bore on Rotator part.

To assemble correctly, use indexing dots to orient the parts.

Please print the supplied 'dumbAdapter_DKL_-_PENF_apertureLabel.pdf' found in the ASSETS folder on adhesive backed paper or apply an adhesive to the back. Then apply it to the aperture ring when you are wide open. Matching the aperture mark with the f-stop number your lens is wide open. F/1.9 is as good as F/2.

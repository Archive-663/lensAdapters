![DKL to PENF adapter](https://github.com/Archive-663/lensAdapters/blob/main/Olympus%20PEN-F/ASSETS/dumbAdapter_DKL_PENF%20(2).jpg)

### Features:
- Simple Push/Pull Lens Lock System.
- Basic F-stop printable label from F/2 to F/22

### What you'll need:
- 9x M1.6 x 5mm pan head screws (if using PETG)

OR

- 9x M1.6/1.7 x 5mm self tapping screws (if using ABS or PETG)
- 1x M1.6 tap
- 1x M2 x 7mm set screw or pan head screw

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit
- M1.8/M2 drill bit

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M1.6 requires M1.4 bore followed by an M1.6 tap.
- M1.8 or M2 bore on Rotator part.

The aperture is controlled by the M2 x 7mm set screw. If you're using ABS I didn't like how the threads felt using a tap, so I'd suggest just screwing the M2 set screw in without a tap. ABS doesn't hold threads as well as PETG which is why I advise using self tapping screws with ABS. It's just, in the case of, the aperture control is better with a flat bottom screw vs the pointed bottom of the self tapping screws.

To assemble correctly, use indexing dots to orient the parts.

Please print the supplied 'dumbAdapter_DKL_-_PENF_apertureLabel.pdf' found in the ASSETS folder on adhesive backed paper or apply an adhesive to the back. Then apply it to the aperture ring when you are wide open. Matching the aperture mark with the f-stop number your lens is wide open. F/1.9 is as good as F/2. 

Please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, <a href="https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">download FreeCAD</a> to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble. If using FreeCAD, the naming conventions should carry over and you will be able to see which lens element you need from the various smartphone lenses. (Verified in FreeCAD 0.18) If using something like Solid Edge open the file as an assembly to retain the names of the parts.

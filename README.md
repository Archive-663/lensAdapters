# Lot no. 002 | Lens Adapters

A collection of lens adapters for a wide variety of cameras.

I'm working on a fully 3d printed adapter for lenses that require a lens locking pin so that the adapters can reach a wider audience without having to buy specialised parts like prewound springs or 2mm rods.

## GFX Dumb Lens Adapters

A collection of basic dumb adapters for using non-Fuji GFX lenses on Fuji GFX cameras.

### Features:
- Available for Bronica S2.
- More mounts coming soon.

### To Print:
- Download the files in the mountDumbBase folder for the GFX Mount
- Download the files for the camera mount you want to adapt. They all use the same GFX mount so keeping them separate makes it easier to update when I need to.
